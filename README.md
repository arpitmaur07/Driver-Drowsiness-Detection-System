# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-
Drivers who do not take regular breaks when driving long distances run a high risk of becoming drowsy a state which they often fail to recognize early enough according to the experts. Studies show that around one quarter of all serious motorway accidents are attributable to sleepy drivers in need of a rest, meaning that drowsiness causes more road accidents than drink-driving. Attention assist can warn of inattentiveness and drowsiness in an extended speed range and notify drivers of their current state of fatigue and the driving time since the last break, offers adjustable sensitivity and, if a warning is emitted, indicates nearby service areas in the COMAND navigation system.
